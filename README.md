#parsley_js

Drupal module to provide integration of forms with parsley.js so that your forms can validate on the client side

##Status
Currently the codebase is in a high state of flux, it will be changing quite a lot as the module progresses.  
The module itself does not currently provide any level of integration except with a testform at /testform  
Once a basic API is working, the ability to integrate with other forms will be provided
