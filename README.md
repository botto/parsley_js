#parsley_js


Drupal module to provide integration of forms with parsley.js so that your forms can validate on the client side

- [ ] Selection of forms to validate on (like IFE)
- [ ] Expose all the various validation types from parsleyjs in FAPI
- [ ] Hook to configure parsleyjs
- [ ] Automated tests
- [ ] Set up milestones and tasks on github issues

##Status
Currently the codebase is in a high state of flux, it will be changing quite a lot as the module progresses.
The module itself does not provide any level of integration except with a testform at /testform
Once a basic API is working, the ability to integrate with other forms will be provided

##Milestones
1. Provide API to allow forms using FAPI validated client side
2. Tests in behat
3. Integration with webform
